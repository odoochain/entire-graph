# AGENTS.md — operating guide for coding agents

Hand this to any coding agent working in a repo where the `entire graph` plugin
is installed. It moves initial code-location work from broad grep/read
exploration to targeted graph queries. Token impact depends on the task and the
model, so treat any single figure as scenario-dependent; the measured range and
the conditions behind it are in the [README](README.md).

Two guidance surfaces coexist here on purpose. `.entire/agent-guide.md` is the
generated activation artifact — regenerated in full by `init-agents`, so never
edit it by hand — and is what agents load through the managed block at the end
of this file. This document is the maintained long-form reference; its examples
pass flags explicitly (such as `--format text`) for readability rather than
relying on command defaults.

## What this gives you

A precomputed code graph is available through the `entire graph` command — functions, classes, methods, types, routes, and the calls/inheritance/field/service relations between them, parsed with tree-sitter. Built-in analysis is local and no-egress (no network, no model, no keys). Use it to **LOCATE** and **UNDERSTAND** code when additional discovery is needed. The same repository view and options yield the same graph, but static relations can be heuristic or incomplete; inspect focused source and verify the resulting change. Some commands write derivative caches or explicitly requested setup/report files; inspect command help when filesystem writes matter.

Default flags to remember: pass `--repo .` when you're not inside an Entire session. The interactive query family (`query`, `def`, `explain`, `neighbors`, and `impact`) reads your **working tree by default** so uncommitted edits are visible; `--head` switches those commands to committed-tree semantics. Other command families have different defaults.

## The parts of the graph

Reach for the smallest tool that answers your question.

### 🔍 query — *find the code for a task* (when discovery is needed)
Ranked source regions for a plain-language description, with the source and `file:line` inline. Hybrid ranking over bodies, identifiers (camelCase/snake_case aware), signatures, paths, and graph neighbors. Output is byte-budgeted to drop straight into context.

```sh
entire graph query --repo . --query "<the task or bug in one plain sentence>" --format text --top-k 8
```

- `--format agent` for compact ranked output with latency telemetry; `json`/`ndjson` for the full schema (completeness, partial failures, diagnostics).
- `--top-k N` result count; `--max-context-bytes N` byte budget (`0` = unbounded).
- Working tree by default (always rebuilt and never cached); add `--head` for cached committed-tree semantics.
- `--profile syntax-only|fast|full` (default `fast`); `--index-all-files` or `--max-indexed-files N` to widen/bound cold-search parsing.

**When:** additional code discovery is needed; reuse locations already supplied by the task or Brain brief.

### 🕸️ neighbors — *who calls this / what does it call* (targeted relations)
Direct incoming/outgoing relations for **one** symbol, with definition locations, plus bounded two-hop paths at `--depth 2`. For the full blast radius of a change, prefer `impact`; use `neighbors` when you want one specific relation/direction. Never `edges` for this (full stream).

```sh
entire graph neighbors --repo . --symbol NAME --relation CALLS --direction in   # who calls NAME
entire graph neighbors --repo . --symbol NAME --relation CALLS --direction out  # what NAME calls
```

- `--file path` — **required** when the symbol name is ambiguous (multiple defs); the graph returns definitions only until you disambiguate.
- `--relation CALLS` (default is the call family) — pick another relation to follow it instead.
- `--direction both|in|out`, `--depth 1|2`, `--limit N`.
- `--internal-only` drops unresolved external endpoints; `--exclude-tests` drops test-only neighbors.
- `--format agent|text|json`; `--head` for cached committed-tree; `--profile fast` for shallow call resolution (default `full` favors correctness).

**When:** "what breaks if I change X", "who uses this", tracing a call chain — after query has given you a concrete symbol name.

### 💥 impact — *one-shot blast radius for a change*
Everything the graph knows about changing **one** symbol, in a single bounded explanation: direct + transitive callers (depth ≤ 2), callees, type consumers (`USES_TYPE`/`PARAM_TYPE`/`RETURNS_TYPE`), data flows, files that historically change together with the symbol's file, and same-container siblings. Text output is sectioned, `file:line` per entry, capped per section and ~4 KB total.

```sh
entire graph impact --repo . --symbol NAME [--file path] [--depth 1|2] [--format text|json]
```

- Ambiguous names return the definition list — rerun with `--file` to pick one.
- `--depth` 1|2 (default: 2); `--limit N` per-section entry cap; `--max-context-bytes N` total text budget; `--exclude-tests`; `--head` / `--profile` as in `neighbors`.

**When:** before changing behavior of a specific function/type — "you're changing ordering: here is every place results are ordered, limited, or consumed downstream" — one command instead of chaining neighbors + edges + git log.

### 📇 symbols — *definitions*
Full stream of symbol records (stable `compound-v1` ID, kind, qualified name, source range, signature, language, container). This is a **bulk NDJSON stream of the whole repo**, filtered to the symbol record type — there is **no positional name argument** and no server-side name filter; grep the stream client-side, or prefer `query`/`neighbors` for a targeted single-symbol lookup.

```sh
entire graph symbols --repo . --format ndjson [--worktree]
```

**When:** you need the complete definition inventory (e.g. ingesting into a store), not a single lookup.

### 🔗 edges — *relations*
Full stream of relation records across all 30 types (`CALLS`, `IMPORTS`, `EXTENDS`, `HANDLES_ROUTE`, …), each tagged with resolution and confidence. The stream is whole-repo by default; `--to`, `--from`, and `--relation` filter it server-side. For one symbol's callers/callees, prefer `neighbors` because it annotates resolved definitions and call sites from source.

```sh
entire graph edges --repo . --format ndjson [--worktree] [--to ID|NAME] [--from ID|NAME] [--relation TYPE[,TYPE...]]
```

**When:** you want every relation (bulk export / ingestion) or a filtered relation stream. For a targeted one-symbol question, use `neighbors`.

### 🗺️ snapshot — *the whole graph*
One header record, then file, external-endpoint, symbol, and relation records, streamed so memory stays bounded. Superset of `symbols` + `edges` + files.

```sh
entire graph snapshot --repo . --format ndjson [--worktree]
entire graph snapshot --repo . --format scip > index.scip 2> index.scip.omissions.json
```

The experimental `scip` format is a complete-snapshot binary projection for
standard SCIP consumers. Native NDJSON remains the lossless default; SCIP
retains one complete index in memory and reserves stderr for its JSON omission
note, so it cannot be combined with `--progress`. Its SCIP package version is the
project's own declared version from the root manifest (`0` when none declares
one), never the commit, so a symbol keeps one identity across commits; worktree
provenance is marked in the note rather than in the version.

**When:** ingesting the full graph into agent memory or a store such as Entire Brain, or exporting a navigation-oriented index to a SCIP consumer.

### 🧬 diff / analyze / commit / checkpoint — *what changed + risk*
Entity-level change list (added / removed / renamed / signature-changed / body-changed) with a heuristic **dependent count**, so a signature change with many dependents stands out.

```sh
entire graph commit HEAD --json                     # a commit vs its first parent
entire graph diff --base main --head HEAD --json    # between two refs (analyze is an alias)
entire graph checkpoint <id> --json                 # the commit behind an Entire-Checkpoint trailer
```

**When:** judging whether a change is safe to keep / revert / continue, or reviewing a branch/PR. High dependent counts on a signature change = run tests first.

### 🏗️ index — *build / warm one cache variant*
Prebuilds a durable, complete committed-tree snapshot and verifies it was
written before latency-sensitive work. Reuse is cache-variant-specific: a
later `--head` query finds the entry only when caching is enabled and it
resolves the same cache directory, profile, ordered ignore/include paths and
contents, and `.graphignore`.

```sh
entire graph index --repo . --head --profile full --cache-dir /path/to/cache --format json
```

**When:** once, up front, on a large repo before a batch of `--head`
searches/neighbors queries that use the same cache variant. `index` defaults to
`--profile full` while `query` defaults to `fast`, so the command above warms
neither a default `query --head` nor the default working-tree agent path.
Match the whole variant: unchanged keyed inputs and tree produce a hit, while
a changed tree or changed input selects or builds another entry.

### 🧭 capabilities / version — *feature-detect*
```sh
entire graph capabilities --json    # semantic vs inventory-only languages, relation types, features
entire graph version [--json]       # provider name + plugin version
```

**When:** before assuming a language is semantically parsed, or to confirm which build is installed.

### 📊 stats — *did the graph actually save anything?* (for humans, not for you)
```sh
entire graph stats --repo . [--since 30d|7d|all] [--format text|json] [--sessions-dir path|--transcript path]
```

Local, read-only report over the coding-agent session transcripts already on disk
(`~/.claude/projects/<path-slug>/*.jsonl`; `--sessions-dir` overrides the lookup). Reports graph
calls per verb vs. exploration calls (`Read` whole-file / `Read` line-range / `Grep` / `Glob` /
shell `grep|find|cat|head|tail|sed|awk`), the bytes each path pulled into context, billed session
tokens read from transcript `usage`, a graph-first rate (share of sessions whose first locate-ish
tool call was a graph call), and an **estimated** token saving. The savings model is an explicit
assumption printed next to the number: each `query`/`neighbors`/`impact` call is credited with the
one whole-file read it replaced — on-disk size of the top-hit file it pointed at (repo median
tracked-file size when unresolvable) minus the bytes that call returned, floored at 0, at 4 bytes =
1 token. It is not a measured counterfactual. No network, no writes. `--transcript <path>` narrows
the whole report to one session (that transcript plus its `<session>/subagents/*.jsonl`), which is
what `scripts/entire-graph-statusline.sh` renders as a live Claude Code status line badge.

**When:** a human asks what the graph is buying them. Agents should not run it as part of a coding task.

## Repository-specific workflow

Follow `.entire/agent-guide.md`, generated from repository state. Both Graph-only
and combined instructions make the same first-action obligation: the first action on
any task that requires finding code is ONE
`entire graph query --repo . --profile full --query "<task>"`.
That holds for small edits, follow-ups, tasks that already name the file, and tasks
where a Brain brief has already reported locations — a brief reports where code is,
not what depends on it. Combined instructions also begin substantive orientation with
`entire brain brief "<task>" --json` unless equivalent task context is available.
Use Graph for discovery, structural analysis, and semantic revision comparisons, and
Brain for retained knowledge, prior decisions, and checkpoint/session history.

Current source and executed tests establish present behavior; historical answers
explain prior intent. Investigate disagreements. A failed query is reported and falls
back to direct source inspection for that query only — it does not retire the tool for
the session — and does not authorize automatic installation, configuration, or repair.
See [the contract](docs/agent-coordination.md).

## Operating doctrine

1. **Answer the information gap.** Follow the generated workflow; query Graph when further discovery is needed.
2. **Treat results as evidence, not truth.** Read focused source around the result and widen the check when behavior, aliases, generated code, or dynamic dispatch could matter.
3. **Use graph follow-ups when they answer a real question.** `impact`, `callers`, and `neighbors` are appropriate for blast radius and related-site checks; avoid exploratory whole-graph dumps.
4. **Make the smallest complete change.** Check sibling sites and contracts when the task implies them.
5. **Verify before stopping.** Run the `VERIFY:` command when query prints one; it may be a whole-suite fallback when no narrow command exists. Never report that tests pass without having run them. If execution is unavailable, perform a bounded source-level verification and disclose the limitation.
6. **Optimize context after correctness.** Prefer precise queries and line ranges, but never trade resolution for fewer turns.
7. **Account for semantic coverage.** Inventory-only files have file records but no semantic relations; verify incomplete results against current source.

Quick mental model:

```text
locate  →  entire graph query --query "..."          (ranked code + file:line)
impact  →  entire graph impact --symbol X              (one-shot blast radius: callers, types, data flow, co-change)
callers →  entire graph neighbors --symbol X ...       (targeted callers/callees of X)
change  →  entire graph diff --base A --head B          (entity-level, with dependents)
ingest  →  entire graph snapshot --format ndjson        (whole graph)
report  →  entire graph stats --repo .                  (human-facing: graph vs grep/read usage + estimated token savings)
```

## Working on entire-graph itself

If your task is modifying this repository (not just using it), the build/test surface is in `mise.toml`:

```sh
mise run build   # go build -o entire-graph ./cmd/entire-graph  (needs CGO for tree-sitter)
mise run test    # go test ./...
mise run check   # fmt + vet + race tests + build
```

Contract rules that must not break: schema `1.x` is frozen and additive-only (`docs/adr/0001-ga-schema-contract.md`); the provider is **no-egress** (never add remote fetches, hosted API calls, telemetry, or runtime grammar downloads); `compound-v1` symbol IDs must stay stable across ordinary edits, and any parser change that RE-KEYS existing symbols must bump `IdentityRevision` (`internal/sem/provider.go`) in the same commit — the record and search caches are keyed on the git tree of the source, which a parser edit does not change, so without the bump upgraded users keep being served the old symbols from a stale cache and the fix is invisible; unsupported/unparseable files must surface as machine-readable partial failures, never silent drops. All logic lives under `internal/` (`sem` = parsing/graph/search, `cli` = hand-rolled dispatch, `gitutil` = git subprocess); `cmd/entire-graph/main.go` is a thin entry point. The plugin manifest (`entire-plugin.yml`) registers the subcommand `graph`, so users type `entire graph ...`. This project was **previously named `entire-sem`** — do not reintroduce the old name. **Entire Brain** (`entire-brain`) is the separate downstream consumer of this provider's NDJSON — not an old name for this project.

### Working in a scratch worktree: adopt the session first

Entire binds an agent session to the worktree it started in, and links a commit to
that session through a `Entire-Checkpoint:` trailer added by its git hooks. Commits
made in a DIFFERENT worktree are not linked: no checkpoint, no trailer, and the
work is absent from `entire checkpoint list` even though the hooks are healthy and
`entire doctor` reports nothing wrong.

That is easy to hit precisely because reviewing a pull request should happen in a
scratch worktree rather than the primary one. Before the first commit in it, run
from inside the scratch worktree:

```sh
entire session adopt <session-id> --from /path/to/primary/worktree
```

`entire session current` shows the id, and `entire session info <id>` shows which
worktree a session is bound to and how many checkpoints it has. A session that has
made commits but reports `Checkpoints: 0` is the symptom.

If it is already too late, `entire session attach <session-id>` builds a checkpoint
from the transcript and links it to the last commit. Two cautions:

- It attaches to the last commit **of the current branch**, so make sure that
  branch is up to date first. A primary worktree that has only ever fetched still
  points at whatever it was on when the session started.
- Do not pass `--force` on a branch whose tip is already pushed: that flag amends
  the last commit to add the trailer, which rewrites published history. Without it
  the checkpoint is still created and the trailer is printed to paste into a later
  commit instead.
