// and unindexed — a rename into a vendored tree, a rename out of one, or a file
// whose tree re-includes it on one side only. Deciding that from the destination
// path alone gets both crossings wrong: it discards the removals the base side
// still owes a consumer, and it reports a body change against a base file that
// no snapshot contains while never naming the head file's other symbols at all.
//
// So each side is decided independently and the status is rewritten to match:
//
//	base yes, head yes   unchanged
//	base yes, head no    a deletion of the base path; its symbols leave the graph
//	base no,  head yes   an addition of the head path; all of its symbols are new
//	base no,  head no    dropped
//
// Rewriting to "D" and "A" needs no new emission code: both are ordinary
// raw-diff inputs, and the loop above already derives its read plan from
// Status alone. The emitted FileChange.Status is then the graph's truth rather
// than Git's — a rename out of the index IS a deletion of everything the index
// held.
//
// A rewrite restates the status; it does not restate what the entry IS. The
// surviving side's tree entry mode must therefore travel with it, because the
// loop above classifies on mode: a rewritten entry that arrives with an empty
// OldMode/NewMode reads as an ordinary blob, so an added or deleted symlink
// would be parsed as source. Any field that decides how an entry is read has to
// be carried here for the same reason.
//
// A copy (status "C") is the one entry that is never a comparison at all: its
// source still exists, so the destination is purely an addition and must never
// be reported as a deletion of, or a change to, the file it was copied from.
// ChangedFiles asks for --find-renames and not --find-copies, and Git emits "C"
// only under --find-copies-harder, so this is a guard against a future flag
