// THE UNIT OF RETRIEVAL FOR PROSE IS THE SECTION, NOT THE FILE. Ranking returns one region per
// unit, which is right for code — a second region of a function the caller can already see is
// worth less than the first region of one it cannot — and wrong for prose. A markdown document is
// not one indivisible thing: it is a sequence of headed sections, and a reader asking a question
// about a 400-turn chat log or a long design note wants the sections that answer it, not the one
// span the ranker liked best in each file. Every comparable document retriever splits a document
// on its headings for exactly this reason; keying the unit by file made entire-graph the outlier,
// and it imposed a hard cap: a corpus of N documents could never return more than N regions
// however large --top-k was, because there were only N units to rank.
//
// So a region that the parser recognized as belonging to a distinct section (markdown headings are
// parsed as `section` symbols) is its own unit, and competes on its own score exactly as an
// independent file would. A region with no symbol identity has no section to belong to, so it
// falls back to the file — which is the previous behaviour, and is what prose formats with no
// heading structure keep getting.
//
// The line is part of the key because a symbol ID names a heading, not an OCCURRENCE of one: a
// document that heads twelve entries "## note" carries twelve identically-identified sections, and
// keying by ID alone would collapse them back into the single unit this change exists to split.
//
// The unit is keyed by section only for regions of a DOCUMENT. The corpus gate is counted over the
// whole candidate path mix, so a docs-heavy repository opens it while still containing source
// files; without this check those files would be keyed by symbol too, and since a source file has
// many symbols they would each contribute many units. That is not merely off-model — one region per
// unit is what enforces MaxRegionsPerFile for code, so removing the rule silently uncaps it. A
// source region therefore keeps falling back to its file, which is exactly its previous behaviour.
