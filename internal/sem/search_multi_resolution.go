// MULTI-RESOLUTION RETRIEVAL
//
// Ranking returns at most one result per file, because for code search a second region of a file
// the caller can already see is worth less than the first region of a file it cannot. That rule is
// right for code and wrong for prose: one markdown file is one document — a design note, a meeting
// log, a chat session — and the answer to a question about it is routinely spread across several
// distant regions of the SAME file. For those files the ranker already computes the extra regions
// and attaches them to their parent as `passages` (search_prose_passage.go), but a consumer that
// reads `results[]` and nothing else never sees them: the parent result carries one span, and the
// rest of the evidence sits in a field it did not ask about.
//
// So when the caller asked for more results than the ranking could fill with distinct files, the
// leftover slots are spent promoting those already-computed regions to first-class results. Two
// resolutions of the same document are then returned side by side: the parent's own span, which
// keeps the surrounding context, and the finer spans, which are the precise evidence.
//
// The rule that keeps this from becoming `--deep` (which traded breadth for depth and measured
// worse) is that promotion is STRICTLY ADDITIVE: it runs after selection, only into slots the
// distinct-file ranking left empty, and only within the byte ceiling the caller set. It can never
// displace a file. `--top-k` still means "number of returned regions", and when the ranking already
// filled it, the output is byte-identical to single-resolution.
//
// Ordinary code search is untouched: no code result carries passages, so there is nothing to
// promote.
