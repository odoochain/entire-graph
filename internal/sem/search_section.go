// Result sections
// ===============
//
// `search` answers "where do I edit to fix this?", so its ranked list is read as a list of
// candidate FIX SITES. Two kinds of entry are legitimately in the payload without being that:
//
//   - Non-code hits: prose documentation, HTML templates, changelogs, serialized
//     configuration, recorded fixtures. Measured over 295 agentic SWE-bench instances, a
//     non-code file is rank 1 on 9.8% of them (29/295). The multiplicative file-class prior
//     already makes such a hit prove itself before it can win, but when it wins anyway an
//     agent reads it AS the fix site and spends its read window on a file no patch can land
//     in (measured: a `website/templates/.../*.html` hit ranked first over the handler that
//     actually had to change, and the agent's window never contained the gold line).
//
//     Non-code hits are still real evidence — an adapter fixture or a rule document is
//     sometimes exactly the file that has to change, and instances are measured where the
//     useful rank-1 hit IS non-code — so they are never suppressed, dropped or re-ranked.
//
//   - Related sites (searchSectionRelated): not ranked answers at all, but the other places
//     the top hit's change usually has to land. See search_related.go.
//
// Sectioning is therefore a LABEL, not a filter: every hit stays in `results`, keeps its rank
// and stays reachable. Renderers group by section, so the list an agent reads as "candidate
// fix sites" contains only entries that could be one.
//   - The covering test (searchSectionCoveringTest): the test that exercises the top hit. It is
//     the one entry in the payload whose file the ranker deliberately DEMOTES, and it is here
//     precisely because a test is not a fix site — it is the statement of what the fix has to
//     achieve. Labelling it away from the primary list is what makes it safe to include at all.
//     See search_covertest.go.
