// Cross-language type resolution.
//
// A bare type name in a signature is resolved against the workspace-wide
// short-name index, which is keyed by name alone. Nothing in that index says
// which language a declaration was written in, so a workspace-unique name
// matched confidently across a language boundary: an Erlang `-record(point,
// ...)` became the resolved type of an R function whose parameter happened to
// be called `point`. The edge is not merely low-confidence, it is impossible —
// R cannot name an Erlang record — and it is unstable as well, because adding a
// second `point` anywhere in the corpus makes the short name ambiguous and the
// invented edge silently disappears.
//
// Plain "same language only" is the wrong repair: C++ and Objective-C compile C
// headers verbatim, Swift imports C and Objective-C declarations through the
// Clang importer, every JVM language names Java classes directly, TypeScript
// and JavaScript share one type system, and F# names C# types. Those edges are
// real and must survive. What the resolver needs is a language *compatibility*
// relation: which languages can legitimately name each other's type
// declarations.

// typeSharingLanguageGroups lists sets of languages that genuinely share type
// declarations, i.e. where source in one language may name a type declared in
// another by its bare name. A language may appear in more than one group, so
// the resulting relation is symmetric and reflexive but deliberately NOT
// transitive: ClojureScript shares declarations with Clojure (`.cljc` sources
// are read by both) and Clojure shares them with Java (JVM class names appear
// in type hints), yet ClojureScript cannot name a Java class.
//
// Languages absent from every group are compatible only with themselves. Pairs
// deliberately left out because their interop is never a bare source-level type
// reference: Elixir/Erlang (Erlang records are macros to Elixir, not types),
// Dart/Java (platform channels are string-keyed), Ruby/C and Python/C
// (extensions are written in C, and the dynamic language never names the C
// struct), Go/C (cgo references are qualified `C.Foo`).
var typeSharingLanguageGroups = [][]string{
	// Shells. `source ./lib.sh` executes the library's functions in the calling
	// shell, so a `.zsh` caller genuinely names functions declared in a `.sh`
	// file. The extensions map to different language labels (Bash and Zsh), and
	// without this pair a sourced helper lost its CALLS edge entirely.
	{"Bash", "Zsh"},
	// The JVM. All of these compile to JVM classes and name Java types
	// directly in signatures and type hints.
	{"Java", "Kotlin", "Scala", "Groovy", "Clojure"},
	// Clojure dialects. The sharing here is narrower than the language pair
	// suggests and is refined by file extension in candidateSharesDeclarations:
	// `.clj` and `.cljc` are BOTH the "Clojure" language, but only `.cljc` is
	// read by the ClojureScript reader.
	{"Clojure", "ClojureScript"},
	// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, declaration files describe
	// JavaScript, and JSDoc annotations in JavaScript name TypeScript types.
	{"JavaScript", "TypeScript"},
	// The CLR. F# names C# types directly.
	{"C#", "F#"},
}

// typeSharingLanguageEdges lists the pairs whose interoperability runs ONE WAY,
// keyed by the naming language. A symmetric group cannot express the C family:
// C++ and Objective-C compile C headers unchanged and Swift imports both through
// the Clang importer, but C has no way to name a C++ class or template, and an
// Objective-C `.m` cannot name a C++ type either -- only `.mm` can. Listing the
// family as one symmetric set therefore licensed exactly the impossible edges
// this file exists to remove, just in the other direction.
//
// Swift reaches C++ as well as C and Objective-C: direct C++ interoperability
// imports C++ types and functions, so `Swift -> C++` is a real edge. The reverse
// is still refused -- C++ has no way to name a Swift declaration.
//
// Objective-C reaches Swift the other way, through the generated
// `<Module>-Swift.h` header: an `@objc` class or method is declared there and is
// named directly from Objective-C, so those type, inheritance, constructor and
// call edges are real.
//
// C++ reaches Objective-C-LABELLED declarations because the label follows the
// file, not the declaration: a header holding any Objective-C syntax is labelled
// Objective-C even where it also declares plain C structs and functions, which
// C++ compiles unchanged. Refusing the pair dropped those edges wholesale.
//
// C reaches them for exactly that reason and no other, which is why it is the
// single target C names. A `.h` is labelled Objective-C the moment it contains
// one `#import` or one `@interface` (see looksLikeObjectiveC), and such headers
// routinely go on declaring the plain C structs, typedefs and functions a `.c`
// includes and compiles verbatim. Measured before this edge, over a fixture
// whose `.c` includes an Objective-C-labelled header and an otherwise identical
// plain-C one:
//
//	C/renderGadget -> C/Gadget                    resolved
//	C/renderWidget -> Objective-C/Widget          DROPPED (same declaration)
//
// The edge stays one-way at the family level: C still cannot name a C++ class or
// template, nor a Swift declaration, so nothing else moves. It is narrowed by
// kind in candidateSharesDeclarations exactly as the C++ edge is -- an
// `@interface` or a selector is no more nameable from C than from C++.

// a target the same way: take the candidates with this name, pick one. Measured
// before this filter, a Ruby `Point.new.process` resolved to a GO method
// (`Ruby/make -> Go/Point.process`, resolution=type_inferred) purely because Go
// declared the only other `Point`.
//
// Filtering the CANDIDATES rather than the emitted edges matters for the same
