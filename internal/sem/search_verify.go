// The verify command
// ==================
//
// Measured across real agent sessions, 3.79 turns per session go on test-and-build — and a large
// part of that is not running the tests, it is finding out HOW to run them: the wrong package
// selector, the wrong filter syntax, the whole suite when one module was meant, a command that has
// to run from a subdirectory. An agent asked for this directly: "bundle test artifacts with the
// located symbol (fixture path, snapshot path, the exact `cargo test` filter) — saves 1.5 turns. On
// a snapshot-test repo this is the difference between verifying and hoping."
//
// So this block emits ONE line: the narrowest test invocation for the file the top hit is in, plus
// the file it targets and the evidence it was derived from.
//
// Every input is repository evidence — a build manifest that exists, and the covering test the
// payload already found. Nothing is guessed, and the block's most important behavior is SILENCE: a
// wrong command costs strictly more than no command, because the agent runs it, reads a failure
// that is about the invocation rather than the code, and then does the discovery anyway. Whenever
// the manifest does not license a narrow command, nothing is emitted. Ant, plain CMake and every
// unrecognized build system therefore get nothing, on purpose.
//
// The command is always runnable from the repository root: when the manifest that licenses it is not
// at the root, the emitted line carries the `cd` that makes it true.

// searchVerifyRakeTestTaskGeneratorPattern matches a Rake::TestTask / Minitest::TestTask generator
// call that defines the task `test`, under the same discipline as the `task` forms above:
// line-anchored, so a comment, prose or a shell line inside another task cannot license the command.
//
// Substring-matching "TestTask.new" did not. `# Rake::TestTask.new` — the shape a Rakefile is left
// in when the task is retired — counted as a declaration, and so did a NAMED generator: the name is
// TestTask#initialize's first argument and :test is only its DEFAULT, so `Rake::TestTask.new(:spec)`
// defines `spec` and the emitted `rake test` dies on "Don't know how to build task 'test'".
//
// So the name has to be `test`, in one of the two ways a generator can say so. Either it is omitted
// and Rake's default stands — the call ends the line, or carries only empty parentheses, a `do`/`{`
// block or a trailing comment — or it is written out as the first argument, as `:test`, `"test"`,
// `'test'`, or the `test:` / `:test =>` dependency key. Anything else is left alone rather than
// guessed at: a name held in a variable, or an argument list broken across lines, declines and the
// derivation stays silent, which is the direction this block already prefers to a command that
// cannot run.
//
// The namespace prefix is optional and repeatable so that `Rake::TestTask`, `Minitest::TestTask` and
// a bare `TestTask` after `include Rake::DSL` all match, while `RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new` and a
// project's own `MyTestTask.new` — whose default name nothing here knows — do not.
//
// Leading whitespace is admitted, so a generator nested in a namespace still MATCHES here — which
// is correct, because it is a declaration. What it declares is `foo:test`, and naming the task is
// no longer this pattern's job: `searchVerifyRakefileTestTask` qualifies every match against the
// namespace stack, so issue #205's case emits `rake foo:test` rather than a `rake test` that does
// not exist. This comment used to say the case was left behaving exactly as it did; it no longer
// is.
//
// The name may also be written on its own line — `Rake::TestTask.new(\n  :test\n)` is one ordinary
// way to format the call — so INSIDE the parentheses the separator spans newlines. Only there: the
// unparenthesised spelling stays on its line, and the whole match still begins at a line's first
// non-blank byte, so a commented-out generator, prose and an `sh` line inside another task are
// declined for the same reason as before, whether or not they run across lines. The name itself is
// still validated, so a multi-line `Rake::TestTask.new(\n  :spec\n)` declines exactly as its

// leaves `./gradlew :lib:test` runnable, and passing, about code the edit never touched.

// perfectly shaped `ctest -R ranges-test` command that CANNOT run that test: the guard is undefined by
// default, so the case is compiled out and the command passes without exercising the edit at all. A
// command that silently verifies nothing is worse than the suite command it displaced, because it
// reports success.
//
// The guard is mechanically discoverable — it is a preprocessor line above the test in the same file —
// and mechanically satisfiable for the two ecosystems that use guards this way: a C/C++ `#ifdef X`
// becomes a compile definition, and a Rust `#[cfg(feature = "x")]` becomes `--features x` when the
// manifest declares that feature. Where it cannot be satisfied, the command is still emitted and the
// derivation SAYS the guard is unsatisfied, because "here is the command, and here is why it may not
