// File-class prior
// ================
//
// `search` is a CODE search: the caller's next action is an edit to a source file.
// Some file classes are systematically over-scored by a body-text match yet are
// almost never the edit site:
//
//   - prose documentation restates an issue in the issue's own vocabulary, so it
//     wins BM25 against the code that expresses the same idea in identifiers;
//   - vendored / third-party trees are an upstream copy — editing them is wrong;
//   - generated artifacts are overwritten by the next codegen run;
//   - serialized data and configuration (JSON/YAML/TOML/XML/INI) DECLARE the names an
//     issue talks about — the package, the command, the option — so they match the
//     issue's vocabulary exactly while containing no behaviour to fix;
//   - examples/samples are real code, but secondary to the library they exercise.
//
// The correction is a MULTIPLICATIVE prior on the positive part of a candidate's
// score, not a filter: a non-source hit stays reachable (and still ranks first
// when nothing else matches at all), it just has to be clearly more relevant than
// the best source hit to outrank it.
//
// Defaults are principled, not tuned:
//
//	nonSource = 0.5   "must be twice as relevant as the best source hit to win"
//	secondary = 0.75  "a mild tilt away from example code toward the library"
//
// The prior is switched OFF for a class whenever the query itself asks for that
// class (`searchQuerySupplied`), which is how a genuine documentation task keeps
// full-strength documentation ranking.

	//
	// It is below the secondary prior because a fixture or a benchmark is real code a fix may edit,
	// whereas an uninitialised declaration can only change if its TYPE changes, which the query would

	// previous($fallback = false);` is a PHP interface method and nothing else — and so is an
	// ANNOTATION or ATTRIBUTE argument, which is why the FIRST parenthesised group cannot simply be
	// skipped as the parameter list: in `@JvmName("f") fun f(x: Int = 3);` the first group belongs
	// to the annotation, and skipping it left the default argument in the scanned tail and read the
	// declaration as an expression body. Reading depth instead does not care which group is which.

	// PARAMETER writes its default: `template <class T = int> void reset();` and TypeScript's
