// Snippet byte allocation.
//
// A search result whose snippet stops in the middle of the function that has to change
// buys the agent nothing: it still has to open the file, which costs a whole extra turn,
// and a turn re-reads the entire conversation context. Measured on agentic SWE-bench
// sessions, 95.9% of billed tokens are context re-read and a mean turn re-reads ~47.5k
// tokens to deliver ~390 tokens of new information, so removing one follow-up read is
// worth far more than the few hundred bytes a complete body costs.
//
// The allocator therefore spends the result byte budget by rank instead of spreading it
// evenly: a hit whose complete enclosing symbol fits is returned WHOLE, and when the
// budget is tight the tail of the ranking is demoted to terse locators to pay for it.
// A tail result's job is to say "also look here" (path, line, symbol name — all of which
// survive demotion); the head's job is to deliver code the agent can act on directly.
//
// How far down the ranking "the head" reaches is set by measurement, not by taste: on the
// same sessions the first hit is the file the agent ends up editing 35% of the time and one
// of the first three 46% of the time, so a two- or three-deep head leaves the majority of
// searches one Read short of an edit. Five is where the marginal body stops paying: it
// covers the ranks an agent actually reads before deciding, and five complete callables is
// still a fraction of the ~42.5k tokens a single extra turn costs.

// EDITABILITY: the forced full-unit upgrade (--full-unit-top)
// ==========================================================
//
// Everything above allocates bodies OPPORTUNISTICALLY: a head rank gets its complete callable when
// one is resolvable, when it is under defaultSearchEnclosureMaxLines, and when the growth allowance
// or a demotable tail can pay for it. Measured against real benchmark payloads, that leaves the
// share of needed edits whose replaced text appears VERBATIM in the payload at ~11%, and the misses
// are not budget misses — they are the three conditions themselves:
//
//   - no ENCLOSABLE CALLABLE. searchEnclosableSymbolKind excludes containers, so a hit inside a
//     class body, a constant table, a type declaration or a build script resolves to nothing and
//     falls through to a 6-line window (and, below the text renderer's second rank, to a bare
//     locator with no source at all — 2 of the 5 hits on redis__redis-10095).
//   - the 160-LINE CAP. A callable longer than that keeps its focused window, which is exactly the
//     case where reading the file back costs the most.
//   - NO DEMOTABLE TAIL at small --top-k. allocateSearchSnippets scans cuts down to
//     minInt(protectedRanks, len(results)); with --top-k 5 and protectedRanks 5 that loop can only ever
//     evaluate "demote nothing", so the whole body budget is the 10 kB growth allowance.
//
// --full-unit-top N bypasses all three for the first N ranks. The unit is resolved as the callable
// first and then as ANY enclosing symbol (that is what recovers type declarations and tables), it
// is bounded only by searchFullUnitMaxLines, and the allocator seats it BEFORE it prices anything
// else, demoting the tail to locators to pay for it. --max-context-bytes still wins: when the
// ceiling cannot hold the forced unit even with every other hit reduced to a locator, the forced
// ranks give their ranked snippets back deepest-first, so rank 1 is the last thing to yield.
const (
	// searchFullUnitMaxLines is the safety cap on ONE forced unit. It is a safety cap, not a
	// judgement about what is worth returning: 400 lines is far past any function an agent edits in
	// one go, so a unit that trips it is a container the caller almost certainly did not mean to
	// ask for whole. Such a unit is CLIPPED to a window containing the hit and says so, rather
	// than being silently dropped back to a 6-line snippet.
	searchFullUnitMaxLines = 400

	// --full-unit-top asked for it. It is reported separately from complete-symbol because the two

	// read", while full-unit says "the caller demanded the enclosing unit at this rank". A forced

	// deliberately NOT complete-symbol, because a clipped unit cannot make the no-follow-up promise.

	// MEASURED FAILURE THAT SIZED THE TWO BOUNDS BELOW. On a 50-instance replay, --full-unit-top 2
	// with --edit-site-bodies made gold coverage WORSE (losers 28% -> 16% against the control), and the
	// mechanism was funding, not retrieval: forcing a unit on a non-gold rank 1/2 exhausted the 24 kB
	// ceiling and demoted a LOWER rank that had been carrying a complete gold-covering body down to a
	// bare locator. On redis__redis-11734 the control gave rank 4 the whole `bitposCommand`
	// (src/bitops.c:882-1008, complete-symbol) and the forced run turned it into
	// `4. src/bitops.c:882 bitposCommand` with no source at all, losing three gold hunks — paid for by
	// a 273-line type at rank 2 on another instance and a 61-line header window here.
	//
	// The fix is an INVARIANT, enforced in seatForcedSearchUnits: a forced unit may never reduce any
	// other rank's rendered source. These two bounds are the second half of it — they stop the
	// pathological growth at the source rather than only refusing to pay for it.

//     Everything else is funded by demoting the tail.
//   - Complete bodies are applied greedily in rank order while the plan fits, so a symbol
//     too large for the allowance degrades to its focused window instead of blowing it.
//   - Only the body head (`bodyRanks`) is eligible for a body. Below it the agent is deciding
//     "is this worth opening", not editing, so a whole callable there spends the head's
//     budget on code that will not be read.
//   - `protectedRanks` is the SEPARATE, usually deeper head that is never demoted to a locator.
//     The two limits answer different questions — "who may be shown a whole callable" and "who
//     must at least stay a snippet" — and --body-head-ranks moves only the first. Collapsing them
//     into one parameter made `--body-head-ranks=2` silently tersify ranks 3-5 as well, which is
//     the opposite of that flag's contract: a tail locator is the only mention of its file, and
//     the gold file sits at rank 6-8 on 17% of instances, so the locator head is deliberately
//     left where it is. See the measurement above searchEnclosureHeadRanks' use in search.go.
//   - Among the plans that deliver the most complete bodies, the CHEAPEST is chosen, so the
//     tail pays for a body before the growth allowance does and demotion never happens
//     without buying something. Ties go to the plan that demotes fewest results.
//   - `plain` is the enclosure plan the SAME inputs produce with --full-unit-top off. It is what makes
//     the forced route non-destructive: the control allocation is computed from it, and a forced unit
