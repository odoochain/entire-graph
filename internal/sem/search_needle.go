// Repository-wide literal lookup, without a second corpus pass
// ============================================================
//
// Two blocks need the same primitive: "where else in this repository does this exact string
// occur, and what symbol encloses each occurrence" — the same question `grep` answers, which is
// the call agents rate highest and which search cannot fold in without paying for a second scan
// of the corpus.
//
// It is not paid for twice. Preselection ALREADY matches every discovered file against every
// query term (search.go, scoreFile), so the per-term posting list is a by-product of work the
// search has already done; all that is added is the line numbers, read from at most
// searchNeedleMaxReads files. A needle is only ever looked up through a query term it CONTAINS,
// so the posting list for that term is a superset of the needle's own occurrences and the
// repository-wide total is exact rather than sampled.
//
// Three sources, in order of cost, and NONE of them is a repository walk:
//
//  1. posting lists from preselection — free, exact, available whenever preselection scanned the
//     whole corpus (the common case: any worktree search, and any HEAD search without a
//     preindexed graph).
//  2. `git grep -l` for the needle — one subprocess, exact. Used when preselection short-circuited
//     through Git and therefore never scanned content itself.
//  3. the corpus file list — only when it is small enough to read inside the read budget, which
//     is exactly the case where preselection also skipped its content pass.
//
// When none of the three can answer, the answer is NOTHING. A block built on a partial view of
// the repository would state a total it cannot know, and a wrong total is worse than no block:
// "4 hits" that is really 40 tells an agent it has seen the whole picture.
