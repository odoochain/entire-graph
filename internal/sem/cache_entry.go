//
// The cache ROOT is caller-named, and creating and opening it resolves a symlink exactly as
// entry.open does — so the deployments that put the cache somewhere else by linking the cache
// directory itself (another volume, a shared cache, out of a container's writable layer) keep
// working. Everything BELOW the root is named by this program and nothing else: two constants and
// a SHA-256 digest. A symlink at one of those components was therefore planted by whatever owns
// the bytes in that directory, and that is the scanned repository whenever `--cache-dir` or
// `ENTIRE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR` resolves inside a checkout. os.MkdirAll followed such a link and put
// the artifact wherever it pointed.
//
// os.Root alone does not close that, for the same reason it does not close it for `--report`
// (see internal/cli/outputpath.go): it stops a link LEAVING the root but follows one that stays
// inside it, and with the cache directory at the checkout root, `.git` is inside it. Each
// component is therefore opened first and the held directory's identity is compared with an
// Lstat of its name. A link reports a different identity from its target, and a component swapped
// during the open reports a different identity from its replacement; either is refused before the
// held handle receives a write.
//
// Escaping descendant links never produced cache hits because entry.open already refused them.
// In-root descendant links could previously hit, so refusing them is an intentional compatibility
// break: a cache rooted at a checkout must not let a committed link steer derivative bytes into
// `.git` or another repository-chosen directory. Relocation remains supported by naming the
// backing directory as the cache root or making the root itself a symlink. Best-effort query paths
// treat a refusal as a cache miss; the explicit `index` persist path reports it.
//
// This boundary covers repository-controlled path entries and identity substitutions observable
// while a component is opened. Once admitted, a directory is used as a held filesystem capability:
// os.Root deliberately keeps referring to that object if another process with namespace-write
// permission moves it. Concurrent relocation by such a process is outside the cache threat model;
// portable os.Root cannot also pin the object's lexical ancestry, and that process already has the
// authority needed to move existing cache artifacts through the same namespace.
