// Package termsafe neutralizes terminal control sequences in output derived from
// repository content.
//
// Every human-readable verb in this tool prints bytes a scanned repository
// controls: pathnames from `git diff -z`, entity names parsed out of YAML, and
// whole source lines lifted verbatim into snippets. A Git pathname may hold any
// byte except NUL and '/', and a source file may hold any byte at all, so an ESC
// in a filename or a declaration reaches the reader's terminal and is INTERPRETED
// rather than displayed. That is a spoofing primitive: the repository, not the
// tool, decides what the reader believes was reported.
//
// The neutralization sits at the WRITER, not at each print site. The sinks are
// not a handful of auditable Fprintf calls — paths and source text are printed
// from roughly forty places across the search, def, impact, neighbors, and
// callsite renderers, and every renderer added later brings more. Wrapping the
// renderer's writer makes the property structural: a new print site cannot
// reintroduce the hole, because it cannot reach the terminal without passing
// through here.
//
// What survives untouched is chosen so ordinary output stays BYTE-IDENTICAL,
// because output stability is what lets an agent copy a snippet verbatim as an
// edit anchor:
//
//   - LF, TAB, FF and VT pass, being page whitespace the renderers and the
//     scanned sources themselves depend on.
//   - CR immediately followed by LF passes. Snippet lines are split on LF alone,
//     so a CRLF-authored file carries its CR into every printed line; escaping it
//     would put a visible marker at the end of every line of a Windows-authored
//     repository, for no security gain.
//   - A LONE CR is escaped, because carriage-return-without-newline is exactly
//     how an attacker overwrites a line the reader has already seen.
//   - Everything else in C0, DEL, and C1 is escaped to its Go literal form, so
//     the byte is shown rather than obeyed and nothing is silently dropped.
//
// JSON and NDJSON output is wrapped too, but by JSONWriter and for the C1 range
// only. This package shipped asserting the opposite — that encoding/json escapes
// the control characters inside strings, so no raw byte can reach a machine
// format and none of them needs wrapping. That is true of C0 and FALSE of C1:
// encoding/json escapes below U+0020 and folds invalid UTF-8 to U+FFFD, but
// U+0080-U+009F encode to a WELL-FORMED two-byte sequence it copies through
// verbatim. A repository that names a file with U+009D (OSC) and U+009C (ST)
// therefore reaches the reader's terminal with the pair that brackets an OSC 52
// clipboard write, through `entire graph search` with no --format flag at all —
// json is that verb's default. The escape JSONWriter writes is LOSSLESS: \u009d
// decodes to the same code point, so a consumer of the machine formats still
// receives the exact bytes Git reported.
//
// One accepted cost: renderers that trim a payload to a byte budget do so before
// their writer is wrapped, so escaping can push a payload past its budget. Each
// escaped byte grows to at most six, and only input that already contains control
// bytes grows at all, so the overshoot is bounded and reachable only by the
// attacker it defends against.
