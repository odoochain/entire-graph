// Caller-named output files: `index --report` and `verify --record-baseline`
// ==========================================================================
//
// Both verbs write ONE file to a path the CALLER names, and both are documented
// to take a path anywhere on the machine: docs/trust-and-security.md says each
// writes "to the path you give it", and the verify help itself advertises
// `--record-baseline /tmp/base.json`. That freedom is the feature; confining
// every write under the repository would break the documented invocation, break
// `--report ../reports/x.md` in CI, and break every /tmp example on macOS, where
// /tmp is itself a symlink.
//
// The hazard is the other end of that range. When the named path lands INSIDE the
// scanned repository — `--report GRAPH_REPORT.md`, the in-repo spelling the tool
// prints — the file sitting at that path was chosen by the repository, which is
// untrusted input. A hostile clone commits GRAPH_REPORT.md as a mode-120000
// symlink; os.WriteFile follows it, and the report bytes truncate and replace
// whatever it points at while the link survives for the next run.
//
// So the rule is conditional, and the condition is OWNERSHIP:
//
//   - OUTSIDE every checkout the --repo spelling implicates: write exactly as
//     before. A symlink there was placed by the caller or their operator, not by a
//     scanned tree, and anyone who can plant it can write the file directly. This is
//     the same reasoning that leaves cache writes unconfined (see
//     internal/sem/cache_entry.go).
//   - INSIDE any implicated checkout: the path is repository-controlled, so the
//     write goes through os.Root — which cannot be made to leave its repository root
//     — and a symlinked component at ANY depth is refused rather than followed.
//     os.Root alone is not enough for the second half: it stops the write leaving
//     the root, but it happily FOLLOWS a link that stays inside it (on every
//     platform, Windows included), and `.git/config` is inside it. The refusal
//     covers the ROUTE the path is read through as well as the destination it names,
//     because resolving the directory part can erase a repository link from the
//     canonical destination — through "..", or through an external alias that
//     enters below the root and reaches a second link — see
//     refuseSymlinkedComponents and, for the route, refuseTraversedSymlinks.
//
// Those are CHECKS, and a check is not the enforcement. The write itself is opened
// component by component, holding each one open and verifying it by identity, so
// there is no window between deciding and opening for the repository to swap a link
// into — see openConfinedOutputFile.
//
// Two things decide "inside", and both exist so that a SPELLING cannot move the
// boundary. The root is the checkout's git top level rather than the --repo value
// (confinementRoot, since --repo may name a subdirectory), and containment is
// filesystem identity rather than lexical comparison (containedRel, since one
// directory has many names). Each carries its own reasoning below.

// --repo may name a SUBDIRECTORY (`index --repo internal/cli`), and the untrusted
// thing is the CHECKOUT, not the subtree that was indexed. The root-level files
// are on disk next to the subdirectory and came out of the same hostile clone;
// `git log -z --name-only` (gitutil/git.go:440, which backs co-change) even
// reports paths across the whole top level while git runs from the subdirectory.
// Classifying `--report GRAPH_REPORT.md` against the subdirectory would call that
// root-level file caller-owned and write through whatever the clone left there.
//
// The fallback — repoRoot unchanged — is load-bearing rather than defensive.
// `verify` runs the caller's own test command in any directory they name, and
// that directory is not required to be a git repository at all; a bare repository
// and a plain directory must both keep working.
//
// It is NOT, as this comment used to claim, free of consequence for being a
// narrowing. Narrowing is safe only where there is nothing above repoRoot to
// confine against; when repoRoot IS inside a checkout, narrowing to it is the
// original escape, because the checkout's root-level files then sit outside the
// narrowed boundary, classify as caller-owned and take the unconfined write,
// straight through whatever symlink the clone committed there.
//
// Asking git is not a reliable way to find that out, because
// the question is answered by an EXTERNAL PROGRAM that fails for reasons which have
// nothing to do with the answer: no git on PATH (`verify` needs none, and indexing a
// mounted tree from a minimal image is an ordinary way to run this), a checkout whose
// files another uid owns, so every git command in it stops at `detected dubious
// ownership`, or a --repo that is a committed symlink to a directory outside the
// checkout, where `rev-parse` runs somewhere that is not a repository at all.
//
// So a failure to ASK is not evidence of an ANSWER. discoverCheckoutRoot reads the
// same thing git would, from the filesystem, and the fallback is taken only once that
// finds nothing either.
//
// This function answers with ONE root, and one root is not always the whole answer:
// when --repo is spelled through a symlink, the checkout the SPELLING sits in and the

// leaves the other one unconfined. confinementRoots is what the write path uses; this

//
//   - the checkout the link RESOLVES into, which is the tree that actually gets
//     indexed. `<unrelated>/alias` -> `<hostile>/sub`: the lexical `.git` search
//     stops at <unrelated>, the boundary becomes a checkout the scan never reads,
//     and `--report <hostile>/GRAPH_REPORT.md` classifies as caller-owned and takes
//     the unconfined write straight through the committed link.
//   - the checkout the SPELLING sits in, which is the tree that COMMITTED the link.
//     `<hostile>/alias` -> `<other>/sub`: git resolves the alias and reports <other>,
//     so the boundary is the tree the caller was pointed AT, and
//     `--report <hostile>/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — a link the same clone committed
//     alongside the alias — is outside it and takes the unconfined write.
//
// Both were live, and each is the other's mirror: the first needs git to be

// keeps the on-disk reading, so the destination does not move.
//
// The cleaned spelling is classified second, and only for a route the REPOSITORY
// controls. The two spellings disagree exactly when a ".." is traversed through a
// link, and which one to keep turns on who owns that link:
//
//   - the repository's own (`link` -> .git/objects, then `--report link/../config`):
//     on disk that leaves the repository, and calling it caller-owned is the escape.
//     The cleaned spelling stays under the root, so it is what carries the path into
//     the confined write where the traversal is refused.
//   - the CALLER's, outside the repository (`/work/link` -> /other/a/b, then
//     `--report /work/link/../repo/out.md`): the kernel opens /other/a/repo/out.md
//     and the cleaned spelling names /work/repo/out.md, a different file that

//     caller's output and truncates a file they never named. There is nothing to

//     whole out-of-repository write unconfined — so the on-disk destination stands.
//
// Even when the spellings agree because there is no "..", the route is still
// classified. A caller-owned alias can enter below the repository root and then

//
//   - CASE. filepath.Rel compares bytes even where the filesystem does not, and
//     macOS and Windows are both case-insensitive by default. filepath.EvalSymlinks
//     does not canonicalise the case of ordinary components either, so a re-spelled
//     root (/repo against /Repo) reads as a different tree while naming the same
//     directory. No exotic setup is needed to reach it: the root here comes from
//     `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, which reports the on-disk spelling, while the
//     output path is spelled however the caller typed it.
//   - OTHER NAMES FOR ONE DIRECTORY. Identity also absorbs the rest of that family
//     — the /private/tmp git reports for a checkout under /tmp, a macOS TMPDIR under
//     /var (a link to /private/var), a Windows 8.3 short name — none of which a
//     lexical prefix test survives and all of which name the same directory.
//
// os.Stat FOLLOWS links, which is right for every ancestor and would be wrong for
// the final component — that component is the symlink a confined write exists to
// refuse — so the walk starts at the target's parent and the final component stays
// a name. Ancestors that do not exist yet simply fail to match and the walk
// continues past them, which is the ordinary case: `verify --record-baseline` is
// documented to create its parent directories.
//
// The walk runs over BOTH the named chain and the resolved one, and inside wins,
// because each chain alone is wrong in one direction:
//
//   - the NAMED chain is defeated by a caller-owned link that points INTO the
//     repository (`/elsewhere/link` -> `<repo>/sub`, then `--report link/x.md`):
//     its lexical ancestors leave the repository immediately, yet the file it
//     names is a repository-controlled path;
//   - the RESOLVED chain is defeated by a committed symlinked DIRECTORY (`out` ->
//     /etc, then `--report out/x.md`): it resolves outside the repository, and
//     calling that caller-owned is precisely the escape being closed.

// repository can change the answer. A directory the check accepted becomes a link
// to .git, os.Root resolves a link that stays inside the root, and .git/config is
// truncated by a write whose every check passed. That is not another SPELLING of
// the path — it is the same spelling answered twice, differently — so no smarter
// check can close it. The window has to stop existing.
//
// So the destination is reached by OPENING each component and keeping it open,
// never by naming a path and trusting the components to still be what they were:
//
//   - each directory component is opened as its own os.Root, and the handle is
//     what the next component is opened relative to. Once opened it is pinned:
//     renaming or replacing the entry afterwards cannot move the write, because
//     the write no longer goes through the name.
//   - the component is then verified by IDENTITY — os.SameFile between what the
//     name lstats to and what the held handle stats to. os.Root follows a link
//     that stays inside the root, so a symlinked component opens its TARGET, whose
//     identity is not the link's; the two agree only for a component that was a
//     real directory at the instant it was looked at, and that directory is the one
//     now held. This is the portable spelling of O_NOFOLLOW, which os.Root does not
//     accept (rootOpenFileNolog already passes it and resolves the ELOOP itself)
//     and which is undefined on Windows.
//   - the final component is opened WITHOUT O_TRUNC — O_CREATE|O_EXCL first, which
//     Go documents as never following a symlink whatever the OS returns, then a
//     plain O_WRONLY if it already exists — so nothing can be destroyed before the
//     same identity check has run. The truncation happens through the verified
//     handle afterwards, where no name is left to swap.
