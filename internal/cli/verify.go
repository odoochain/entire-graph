// `entire graph verify` — an ADJUDICATED verdict, not test output
// ==============================================================
//
// MEASURED BASIS. Post-last-edit confirmation is 5.8 messages per session, the single largest asymmetric
// pot at 5.0 messages. Every prior attempt to shrink it FREED budget the agent immediately re-spent on
// more verification: transfer efficiency 0.2-0.35, meaning two thirds of every saving went straight back
// into running tests again. A cheaper way to run tests therefore cannot work. The only thing that closes
// the phase is a verdict with nothing left to re-spend on — which requires three properties that
// ordinary test output does not have:
//
//   - A DELTA, not a state. "3 tests fail" invites a run to find out whether they failed before. The
//     pre-edit baseline turns that into "these 3 failed before your edit too", which is not actionable
//     and is explicitly labelled so.
//   - A VERDICT, not evidence. Output is something to interpret, and interpreting invites re-running.
//     The verb states the conclusion and the conclusion's own completeness.
//   - NO RAW OUTPUT, EVER. Forwarding even an excerpt reopens the loop this verb exists to close, so
//     nothing the runner printed reaches the caller. Ids are forwarded; text is not.
//
// FAIRNESS. This verb is tool CAPABILITY — it runs a command the caller supplies and adjudicates the
// result. It prints no instruction the control arm's harness-side stub cannot also print: the
// "verification is complete" sentence is a statement about the DATA (a zero-regression, ≥1-fix delta is
// by definition complete), not advice about how to behave. Nothing here tells the reader what to do.

// ACCEPT two different repositories, because the recorded side was canonicalized at record time and
// two distinct checkouts do not clean to one path. Neither branch re-opens the false accept the
// canonicalization closed.
//
// What identity does NOT claim: it is a fact about the directories AS THEY ARE NOW, not about their

// verifyTestFailureExitCodes is each runner's own code for "a test the run reported did not pass",
// and nothing else. Every other code these runners emit means the run itself came apart — pytest 2
// interrupted, 3 internal error, 4 usage error, 5 nothing collected; cargo's harness failing at 101
// while cargo itself exits 1 when it could not even build; a PHP fatal at 255 — and none of them is
// explained by a test the run happened to report failing before it died.
//
// GO TEST IS THE COUNTEREXAMPLE, and listing {1} does NOT make it safe on its own. Measured on Go
// 1.26.5, the go command spends exit 1 on every way a run can fail — a failing test, a build failure,
// a setup failure, a vet failure, an unknown flag, a missing package — so 1 is simultaneously "the
// code go test uses for a test failure" (which is what this table is for) and "the code go test uses
// for a run that never happened". No exit code can tell them apart, so the OUTPUT is read instead:
// see verifyUnattributedFailures, which is what actually closes that half.
//
// A runner that grades its own outcomes needs every code it grades WITH. PHPUnit is the one here
// that splits them: an assertion failure exits 1 (FAILURE_EXIT) and a test that raised exits 2
// (EXCEPTION_EXIT, checked last so it wins when a run has both). Both are per-test verdicts the
// report names in its numbered block and the parser records as non-passes, so both explain the exit.
// Measured on PHPUnit 9.6.36, 10.5.64, 11.5.56, 12.5.34 and 13.3.2: assertion failure 1, raised 2.
//
// An unlisted runner keeps the old rule (any ordinary nonzero is plausible), because refusing a code
// nobody has documented would be a guess in the loud direction about a runner this build does not
// otherwise know. Where a runner IS listed the set is deliberately narrow: a false INCOMPLETE costs
// the caller one investigation, while a false PASS is the failure class this whole verb exists to
// prevent.
//
// RSPEC IS DELIBERATELY UNLISTED, and that is a statement about RSpec rather than an omission. Its
// failure exit code is CONFIGURABLE — `--failure-exit-code N` on the command line, and
// `config.failure_exit_code = N` in spec_helper.rb — so "the code RSpec uses for a test failure" is
// not a property of RSpec at all; it is a property of the project. Neither source is visible here:
// the configuration lives in a Ruby file this verb never reads, and even the flag can arrive through
// `.rspec`, `SPEC_OPTS` or a rake task rather than the recorded command. Listing {1} therefore
// adjudicated every suite that set the option INCOMPLETE however complete it was, which is the same
// false negative PHPUnit's missing 2 produced. Reading the flag out of the command string would fix
// only the spelling that happens to be on the command line and would still be wrong for the
// configured majority — a narrower guess is still a guess. The permissive rule is the honest answer
// for a runner whose grading codes this build cannot know.
// JEST IS UNLISTED FOR THE SAME REASON, and it is the stronger case of the two because the option is
// documented rather than idiomatic. `testFailureExitCode` is a first-class Jest setting — measured on
// Jest 29.7.0, a failing suite exits 1 by default, 2 under `--testFailureExitCode=2`, 7 under
// `module.exports = { testFailureExitCode: 7 }` in jest.config.js, and 5 under a `"jest"` key in
// package.json. Two of those four sources are files this verb never opens, and the package.json one is
// where the majority of Jest projects keep their configuration, so "the code Jest uses for a test
// failure" is a property of the project rather than of Jest. `vitest` shares the parser and the entry.
//
// Without an explicit declaration, high exit codes remain ambiguous: shells can
// encode signals as 128+N, but configurable runners can also exit normally with
// those numbers. --test-failure-exit-code declares the project's failure status
// instead of inferring it from either the number or arbitrary repository config.
