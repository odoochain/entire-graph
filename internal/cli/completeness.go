// Completeness reporting is a valued feature and is not reduced here — every
// warning and every partial failure stays in the JSON payload, in full. What is
// fixed is the PRESENTATION: an answer about a Rust symbol used to open with
// "degraded ... 273 partial failures" and itemize Python files, which reads as
// "the graph you are about to trust is broken" and pushes a reader back to grep.
//
// A failure is only actionable for a query if it could have removed a fact the
// query would have used. The unit of that relevance the graph actually knows is
// LANGUAGE: a Python parse error cannot hide a Rust caller. Failures outside the
// query's language are therefore reported as one collapsed line, not itemized,
// and the headline says whether the query's own language is clean.
//
// The exception is that a few languages resolve into each other, so the label is
// not always the boundary — see sameCompletenessLanguageFamily.

// maxScopedDiagnostics caps how many in-scope diagnostics are itemized. In-scope
// failures ARE actionable, so they keep the itemized treatment.
