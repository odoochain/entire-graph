// explain — turn a FAILING BUILD into the declarations it is complaining about.
//
// Why this exists, measured on a 30-instance paired haiku run (baseline vs graph-assisted, same
// instances, same prompt discipline):
//
//	                  baseline    graph
//	pre-edit explore     9.43      1.34    <- the locate phase is already won, 86% removed
//	post-edit explore    8.60      6.76    <- barely moved
//	post-edit read       3.57      4.07    <- moved the WRONG way
//	verify/fix total    17.57     16.17    <- 50% of the assisted session, -7.9%
//
// The graph has taken essentially everything available in the locate phase; half of what remains is
// the edit->build->fix loop, and the graph did nothing for it. The reason is not that the graph lacks
// the answer — `def` has it — but that the agent never asks: offering `def` in the prompt for exactly
// this case produced 0.04 calls per session across 28 sessions. Telling an agent to choose a tool
// after its build fails does not work; it is already in the shell, so it greps.
//
// So this is not another instruction. It is a command that composes with the build in ONE shell call,
// and the VERIFY block emits it pre-composed, so the agent runs the command it was given and the
// declarations arrive with the failure:
//
//	( o=$(go test ./internal/configs -run '^TestX$' 2>&1); r=$?; printf '%s\n' "$o" | entire graph explain --repo .; exit $r )
//
// The status capture is not decoration. `<test> 2>&1 | entire graph explain` replaces the test's exit
// status with the PIPE's, which is this command's — so a failing test reports success and the agent
// stops. `set -o pipefail` cannot fix it either: the line runs in whatever shell the caller has, and
// on Debian-family systems /bin/sh is dash, where `set -o pipefail` is fatal rather than merely
// absent. The POSIX capture above keeps the test's own `$?` and exits with it.
//
// One turn replaces build -> grep symbol -> read range. It quotes no source it was not asked for and
// it stays read-only: the build is run by the shell, not by this process, so the provider remains a
// pure analyzer.

	// build could otherwise grow it without limit. Scanned saturates here rather than growing: a
	// build naming more than a thousand distinct missing symbols is already "everything is broken",
	// and an exact count of it buys nothing worth unbounded memory.
	//
	// It is a FLOOR, not a ceiling: a caller asking for more symbols than this raises it (see
	// explainCandidates). The bound exists to keep the BUILD from choosing how much is remembered,
	// and the caller's own --max-symbols is not the build.
