// Addressing one definition
// =========================
//
// `neighbors`/`impact` operate on ONE definition, so a name that resolves to several
// definitions has to be narrowed. `--file` is enough only while the definitions live in
// different files: two definitions in the SAME file with the same qualified name (C
// `typedef struct {...} State` twice, overload sets, a declarator and its
// function-expression value before that duplication was collapsed) are byte-identical
// under both `--file` and a qualified `--symbol`, and the tool used to ask for remedies
// that could not possibly work.
//
// A definition's NAME plus its LINE always separates them, so `--line` is the escape hatch
// that is guaranteed to exist, with `--kind` for the last case where two records share a
// name AND a line. `--symbol <file>:<line>` is also accepted as a positional shorthand, but
// it drops the name and therefore selects every definition on that line — convenient to
// type, not something the tool should recommend.

// symbolRef is a resolved --symbol/--file/--line/--kind address.
type symbolRef struct {
	// Name is the (possibly qualified) symbol name, empty when the address is
	// purely positional (`--symbol path/to/file.ts:83`).
	Name string
	File string
	Line int
	Kind string
}

// parseSymbolRef reads the `--symbol` value together with `--file`/`--line`.
//
// `--symbol <file>:<line>` is accepted only when the trailing segment is a line number AND
// the prefix names a file that is actually in the snapshot. That is what keeps names that
// legitimately contain a colon (`Foo::bar`, `A::B::C`) from being mistaken for a location:
// they do not end in digits, and `Foo::` is not a path in the repo.

// WHERE QUOTING IS AVAILABLE, and where it is not. Single quotes are the POSIX
// form that suppresses every expansion; an embedded single quote is closed,

// not merely ineffective there, it is a false guarantee about the exact
// characters that motivated it — while PowerShell does read `'` as a quote and
// therefore mis-parses the bare spelling cmd.exe needs. The two Windows shells
// disagree with each other as well as with POSIX, so one emitted string cannot
// be right for both, and this process cannot know which one the reader will
// paste into.
//
// So on Windows the answer is NO SELECTOR rather than a second dialect: false
// is returned and the caller withholds the command. That is the incomplete
// answer, not the wrong one — the definition is still listed with its file and

// wrong answers — they were REFUSALS to answer a live query at all. Two messages account for both
// measured blow-ups, and in each case the agent spent the money doing by hand what the tool declined
// to do:
//
//   - "Ambiguous symbol %q matched N definitions; rerun with the selector printed beside the one you
//     mean." — projectlombok__lombok-3486, +$2.22, 78 pre-edit operations while the agent manually
//     disambiguated two same-named methods it had already been told the locations of.
//   - "No symbols matched %q" — phpoffice__phpspreadsheet-3570, +$1.23, BOTH live queries empty and
//     shell greps 18 -> 39, because the query spelled the name in a different but obvious way.
//
// Neither refusal is necessary. Ambiguity means the tool found MORE than it was asked for, which is
// information, not an error; and an exact-match miss on an identifier is a spelling question the graph
// can answer itself. So:
//
//   FIX A  every definition is listed, and the top ones come back WITH SOURCE. No rerun instruction.
//   FIX B  an exact miss degrades to a fuzzy ladder (case, separators, tokens, substring) and returns
//          the best candidates, clearly labelled as fuzzy so the caller is never misled about what
//          matched.
