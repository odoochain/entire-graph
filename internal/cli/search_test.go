// finding on replaySearchPayload: JSONWriter.Write withholds a trailing 0xc2
// (the lead byte of a two-byte UTF-8 sequence) whose continuation byte has
// not arrived yet, on the reasonable assumption that a caller who splits its
// stream across several Write calls will supply it next — and calls it out
// as a caller obligation to call Close for a one-shot replay that will never
// make a second call. A stored payload whose LAST byte is a lone 0xc2 (any
// prior byte in the two-byte sequence being cut off there, not necessarily a
// C1 control) is exactly that one-shot case, and without Close the byte was
// silently dropped from the replay.
