// openFileIdentity reports how many directory entries name an OPEN file's

//
// The link count is the only way to see a HARD link. Every other guard in this
// file reasons about a path — its components, what it resolves to, whether a
// component is a symlink — and a hard link has no path to reason about: `ln
// .git/config CLAUDE.md` makes CLAUDE.md a second name for the same inode, so
// it resolves to "CLAUDE.md", carries no `.git` component, and Lstat reports an
// ordinary regular file. The name is innocent; the inode is not.
//
// It takes the open FILE rather than a FileInfo because Windows can only answer
// either question from a handle, and a guard that no-ops on one platform is not
// a guard.
