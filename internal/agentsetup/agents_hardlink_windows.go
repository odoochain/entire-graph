// openFileIdentity is the Windows half of the hard-link guard. NTFS supports
// hard links (`mklink /H`, CreateHardLink), so the protection has to work here:
// a guard that no-ops on a platform whose filesystem has the feature is a guard
// in name only.
//
// The FileInfo Go exposes on Windows carries neither a link count nor a file
// identity, which is why an earlier version reported "unknown" and skipped the
// check. GetFileInformationByHandle answers both from the open handle:
// NumberOfLinks is the link count, and (VolumeSerialNumber, FileIndexHigh,
// FileIndexLow) is the volume-scoped identity — Windows' equivalent of
// (device, inode).
//
// FileIndex is stable while the file is open, which is exactly the window this
// is used in: the handle is already held, and the answer is only needed for the
// write about to happen on it.
