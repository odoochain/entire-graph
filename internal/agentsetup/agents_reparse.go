// FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT and reads the buffer that comes back. The DECISIONS taken about what
// comes back are ordinary arithmetic and string work, and keeping them here is what lets them be
// asserted from any machine — the alternative is a rule that only a Windows CI leg can ever
// contradict, on a code path whose whole job is to refuse a hostile alias.

// wrong in one direction only, and it is the dangerous one: an undecodable NAME SURROGATE is

// This is the spelling Windows stores in a junction created against a VOLUME rather than a drive
// letter, and it is what a raw reparse buffer holds for one: `\??\Volume{GUID}\sub\file`. It names
// an ordinary local directory — the same directory `C:\sub\file` names when the GUID is that
// drive's volume — but it is spelled in the device namespace, where the confined relative
// operations that follow cannot be applied to it.
//
// The volume root is returned in the `\\?\Volume{GUID}\` form, with its trailing separator,
// because that is the spelling that opens the volume's ROOT DIRECTORY; without the separator the
// same name opens the volume device instead, which is not a directory and not what the identity
// comparison is asking about.
//
// Only the GUID form is recognised. Every other device name — GLOBALROOT, named pipes, network
// providers, `\\?\UNC` — is left to the refusal it already has, because none of them is a local
// directory that a drive spelling can name.
