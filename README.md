# Entire Graph

Agents are continually spending their budgets before they write the first line
of code, rummaging through files, grepping for function names, and re-reading
the same files and configs, as they attempt to understand a codebase fresh with
each session. According to [OpenRouter's Head of Insights](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterjameswalker_february-6th-2026-potentially-the-last-share-7493029881841344512-IK89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABfX0nABz6sCWbPldiV_9liETVfz5fRLAD0), agentic
token usage grew 14x between February and August 2026, up from 0.51 trillion tokens
to 7.3 trillion.

Entire Graph is a plugin for the Entire CLI specifically designed to enable your
agents to stop paying that cost. It hands your agent a precomputed map of a Git
repository: ranked code search plus definitions, callers, types, routes, and
change impact, each with `file:line` locations. The built-in analyzer parses the
repository locally with tree-sitter and makes no network requests, model calls,
or API-key lookups.

When running [LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo) against competitors,
we measured the top score of 94.74% for Entire Graph. We also observed token savings
up to 71% depending on the coding scenario. As always, your mileage may vary.

## Features

- Ranked code search from plain-language task descriptions, combining lexical matches across source bodies, identifiers, signatures, and paths with graph relationships.
- Agent-ready results with source snippets, file:line locations, configurable context budgets, ranking explanations, and suggested verification commands.
- Semantic parsing for 36 languages, including Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Rust, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and Kotlin, plus inventory support for 149 additional language and filetype names. entire graph capabilities --json reports the installed build’s coverage.
- Definition lookup and focused relationship queries for callers, callees, inheritance, type usage, field access, and supported framework routes.
- Change-impact reports combining direct and transitive callers, callees, type consumers, data-flow relationships, same-container symbols, and files that historically change together.
- Entity-level semantic diffs between Git revisions, including added, removed, renamed, signature-changed, and body-changed symbols, with heuristic dependent counts.
- Commit and Entire checkpoint analysis for reviewing changes in their repository context.
- Working-tree queries that include uncommitted edits by default, with explicit committed-tree queries and reusable caches for matching repository states and options.
- Full graph export through versioned NDJSON snapshots, stable symbol identifiers, a compact NDJSON format, and experimental SCIP export.
- Per-repository agent activation, which installs repository-specific guidance in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.
- Machine-readable coverage, exclusions, warnings, and partial failures, with relation confidence and resolution metadata.
- Local analysis with no network requests, model calls, API keys, telemetry, or runtime grammar downloads.

## Benchmarks

To put entire-graph to the test, we ran it through
[LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo), the standard benchmark for
one hard skill: finding a single small detail buried in a pile of text. LoCoMo
asks over 1,500 questions about long conversations that span many sessions and
scores whether the tool can find the right piece of evidence.

On identical questions, entire-graph found the right evidence more often than
any of the seven other systems we tested, including graphify, mem0, and cognee.

## Install

Entire Graph requires Entire CLI 0.10.0 or later and Git 2.36 or later on
`PATH`. Git 2.36 added the single-session object protocol Entire Graph uses to
inspect an object's type before reading its contents. The commands below are
the official ones from the [Entire CLI installation
guide](https://docs.entire.io/installation), which also covers Homebrew, Windows and
other channels.

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://entire.io/install.sh | bash
```

Then **install the plugin** from the plugin index and confirm its version:

```sh
entire plugin install graph
entire graph version
```

`entire graph version` printing a release tag confirms that a versioned build
is active.

## Activate it for your agent

Activation is per repository:

```sh
entire graph init-agents --repo .
```

Add `--strict` to save mandatory Graph/Brain tool-use rules for this repository.
The saved mode is shared by enabled products and inherited on later runs.
Use `init-agents --normal` to reset it. `agent-guide` inherits the saved mode;
`agent-guide --strict` or `--normal` previews an override without saving it.
The two flags are mutually exclusive. New repositories default to normal.

The command creates or updates these files:

- `.entire/agent-guide.md`: the agent operating guide. Generated in full and
  regenerated in full on each successful rerun; manual edits there do not
  survive.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`: created if absent; otherwise one managed block
  between `<!-- entire-agent:begin -->` and `<!-- entire-agent:end -->` markers
  is added or replaced. Text outside the markers is preserved.

Review the three files, then commit them together when the instructions should
apply to your team.

After that, the interface is your coding agent: start it with the new instructions,
then you ask a code question in plain language, the agent runs graph queries,
reads the code the graph points at, and answers with citations. A captured example
is shown further below.

## What to ask

Prompts are the interface. The commands are what the agent runs underneath;
you can also invoke them directly for manual inspection, debugging, or
automation. See the [command reference](docs/commands.md).

| Goal | Example prompt | Graph command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find the implementation | Find where request routing is implemented. | `query` |
| Read one definition | Show the definition of `ResolveRoute`. | `def` |
| Trace callers or callees | What calls `ResolveRoute`? | `neighbors` |
| Check the blast radius | What would changing `ResolveRoute` affect? | `impact` |
| Review a branch | Summarize the semantic changes from `main` to `HEAD`. | `diff` |
| Export the full graph | Export the repository graph as NDJSON. | `snapshot` |
| Inspect indexing health | Show parser coverage and affected files, including healthy results. | `health` |

## Example Session

The transcript below is a real captured session, recorded with pinned inputs: the
installed Entire Graph release, a fresh clone of `gorilla/mux` at commit `db9d1d0` with
no prior agent instructions, activation files committed, and Claude Code
2.1.233 (model Claude Fable 5) as the client. The prompt:

> Without changing any files, find where route matching is implemented in this
> repository, what calls it, and what is most likely to be affected if its
> behavior changes. Cite the relevant source.

The session's tool calls, in order (command syntax updated to the current
interface, the last command truncated):

```text
Bash: entire graph query --profile full "route matching implementation for incoming request paths"
Bash: entire graph impact --symbol Route.Match
Bash: entire graph impact --symbol Router.Match
Bash: sed -n 145,230p mux.go
Bash: sed -n 40,120p route.go
Bash: grep -n "func.*Match\|matcher\b" route.go regexp.go | head -40
Bash: sed -n 185,225p regexp.go; grep -n "\.Match(" mux.go route.go middleware.go ...
```

The first call is a graph query. That is the activation instructions at
work: Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` at session start and resolves its import
of the guide, so the agent reached for the graph before any grep.
Search returns ranked JSON evidence; the top hit for this query was
`Route.addMatcher` at `route.go:237` with `newRouteRegexp` at `regexp.go:41`
right behind it. The agent then asked for blast radius. The start of the
`impact` output it received, verbatim except for one line wrapped to fit:

```text
Index: cache-hit (49ms) | Query: 0ms | Total: 50ms
Impact: Router.Match (mux.go:151) def=151 span=151-182 [method in Router]
Blast radius: 1 caller (1 direct, 0 transitive), 0 callees, 3 type consumers,
  1 data flow, 7 co-change files, 29 siblings.
Callers (1 direct, 0 transitive; who breaks if behavior changes):
- Router.ServeHTTP (mux.go:203, def :188)
```

That point-in-time capture predates ADR 0004's security correction. A current
default working-tree query reports `cache-miss`; committed-tree queries can
still report `cache-hit` when a matching entry exists.

Only after the graph queries did the agent read source, in narrow line ranges
around the reported locations. Its answer traced matching through
`Router.Match` (`mux.go:151-182`), `Route.Match` (`route.go:47-114`), and
`routeRegexp.Match` (`regexp.go:189-209`), and named what a change would
touch: handler dispatch and 404-vs-405 selection, route variables via
`setMatch`, URL reversing built by `newRouteRegexp`, and the CORS middleware
path through `getAllMethodsForRoute`. It also exposed a graph limit that the
agent verified against source: `impact --symbol Route.Match` reports zero
callers, while source inspection finds two direct call sites.

That last point is the working relationship to expect: graph output is
evidence for the agent to check against source, not an oracle. The
[supporting record](docs/evidence/2026-08-16-mux-agent-session.md) includes the
capture conditions, relevant agent and tool events, complete graph-command
outputs, and the final answer verbatim.

Activation succeeds when the managed guide and pointers are present and
`agent-guide` matches the installed guide for the same target and invocation.
Follow the [coordinated workflow](docs/agent-coordination.md): Brain supplies task
context in combined mode; Graph handles further discovery and structural analysis.
Sufficient task or brief locations permit direct source inspection. Ground claims
in inspected source and executed verification.

## Working tree and cache

The interactive query family (`query`, `def`, `explain`, `neighbors`, and
`impact`) reads the working tree by default, so agents see uncommitted edits.
Add `--head` to ask about the committed tree instead. Bulk streams
(`snapshot`, `symbols`, `edges`) and ref-based analysis (`diff`, `commit`)
default to committed state.

Queries can write a derivative local cache; they never modify repository files.
Default working-tree queries always build fresh and do not load or store cache
entries. A `--head` query can reuse a snapshot keyed to the committed tree and
query options; changing `.graphignore` selects a different committed-tree
entry.

Cache state is visible where the format reports it: the default `query` JSON
carries `stats.index_cache_hit`, and `impact`/`neighbors` text output opens
with an `Index: cache-hit`/`cache-miss` line. Default working-tree queries
report a miss; matching `--head` queries may hit. `query --format text` does
not report cache state.

`entire graph index` prewarms committed-tree (`--head`) queries only, and
defaults to profile `full` while plain `query` defaults to `fast`. A default
`index` run therefore does not warm the default working-tree path. One caveat
inside the query family: `def` and `explain` only cache when `--cache-dir` or
`ENTIRE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR` is set, unlike the other query commands. Cache
locations, key inputs, and prewarming are documented in
[operations](docs/operations.md#cache).

## Indexing health

```sh
entire graph health
entire graph health --repo . --json
entire graph health --refresh
```

Health defaults to committed `HEAD` and profile `full`. It reuses the matching
index or announces and builds one; `--refresh` forces a rebuild. The report
includes revision, profile, cache freshness, source totals, unique flagged
files, language/category breakdowns, diagnostic details and intentional skips.
`doctor` remains unchanged.

The degradation threshold is **5% of eligible source files**, inclusive.
Multiple diagnostics for a file count once. Documentation, configuration and
data do not dilute the denominator; minified/oversized skips are excluded from
the numerator. Existing unsafe and empty/unusable-graph safeguards still apply.
Diagnostics remain available below the threshold, including query warnings.
These are parser limitations, not a verdict that the source code is invalid.
See [health accounting and cache behavior](docs/operations.md#graph-health).

## Limits

Static analysis is heuristic. Calls through interfaces, reflection, dynamic
dispatch, and generated or runtime-wired code can be missed or unresolved.
The captured session above shows one such case. Dependent counts are guidance
for inspection, not compiler facts. Files the parser cannot handle surface as
machine-readable partial failures rather than silent gaps.

[Language coverage](docs/language-support.md) has two tiers: 36 languages with
semantic parsing, and inventory-only filetypes that get file and symbol
structure without call or type analysis. Check the current build with
`entire graph capabilities --json`.

Entire Graph is code intelligence for the repository your agent is working in:
ranked search, relationships, and change impact grounded in source. It does _not_
store user or conversation memory, run in the background, or expose its own MCP
server. The full data-flow and write-surface description, including what runs
caller-provided commands, is in
the [trust and security](docs/trust-and-security.md) documentation.
