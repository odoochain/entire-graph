# entire-graph — status line badge for Claude Code.
#
# Renders one line summarising what the code graph bought you in THIS session:
#
#   [GRAPH] ↗ ~6.6K saved
#
# With ENTIRE_GRAPH_STATUSLINE_DETAIL=1 the measured context follows it:
#   [GRAPH] ↗ ~6.6K saved · 13 search · 3 impact · 1 nbrs · vs 2.6K explore · 1.5M explore tok ·
#   graph-first ✗ · 2% of locates · 0.2% of session
#
# Segment order is fixed; any segment whose value is missing or zero is dropped rather than
# rendered as a zero. Only WORK verbs are named (locate verbs search/neighbors/impact first,
# then def/explain/verify/diff/analyze/commit/checkpoint/symbols/edges/snapshot/snapshot-query/
# index). The self-reporting meta verbs — stats, version, help, doctor, init-agents,
# agent-guide, capabilities, health — replace no exploration, so they are struck from the verb
# split AND from the residual "other" count.
#
# The line is held under 152 visible characters. When it would overflow, whole segments are
# dropped from the right — session %, then explore tok, then explore calls — never truncated.
#
# Claude Code invokes a status line command with the session JSON on stdin and takes stdout as
# the badge (ANSI colour is allowed). The fields consumed here:
#
#   .transcript_path        path to this session's JSONL transcript  (required)
#   .workspace.current_dir  repo to resolve the savings counterfactual against
#   .cwd                    fallback for the above
#   .session_id             one half of the render-cache key; a digest of the transcript path
#                           is the other half, because session_id is absent in some invocations
#
# Every number comes from `entire graph stats --transcript <path> --format json`, so the
# accounting is exactly internal/cli/stats.go — command-position-only graph verbs against a
# closed verb allowlist, locate verbs (search/neighbors/impact) alone credited, credit =
# top-hit-file size − returned bytes floored at 0, 4 bytes = 1 token. There is no second
# estimator here to drift out of sync.
#
# Enable it in ~/.claude/settings.json:

#
# Environment:
#   ENTIRE_GRAPH_BIN               explicit path to the entire-graph binary
#   ENTIRE_GRAPH_STATUSLINE_SCOPE  session (default) | project
#                                  project re-scans the whole sessions directory belonging to
#                                  the REPOSITORY (resolved by `stats --repo`, not by where
#                                  the session happened to be launched) — hundreds of MB on a
#                                  busy project, and far too slow to render per keystroke.
#                                  Opt in knowingly. Sessions are grouped by the directory
#                                  Claude Code was launched from, so a repository with no
#                                  sessions of its own renders nothing rather than borrowing
#                                  a parent directory's total. Attributing individual calls
#                                  by their recorded cwd would be finer-grained still; stats
#                                  does not do that yet.
#   ENTIRE_GRAPH_STATUSLINE_SINCE  window for scope=project (default 30d)
#   ENTIRE_GRAPH_STATUSLINE_CACHE  0 disables the render cache (always recompute, in-line)
#   NO_COLOR                       set to any value to drop ANSI escapes
#
# Prints NOTHING and exits 0 on every failure: no binary, no transcript, unparseable JSON,

# --- cache ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Keyed on the session id AND a digest of the transcript path — so two sessions can never share
# an entry — and stamped with the transcript's size+mtime, so an entry invalidates the moment the
# session advances and there is no staleness window to reason about.
#
# A cache MISS serves the previous line and recomputes in the background (stale-while-
# revalidate). A 50 MB orchestrator transcript takes ~450 ms to re-scan, which is far too long
# to hold up a keystroke; the badge is then at most one render behind, which for a
# slowly-accumulating counter is invisible. Only the very first render of a session — when
# there is nothing to serve — computes in line.
# An entry is stored as "<config>\t<stamp>\t<line>":
#   config — everything that changes WHAT is rendered (scope, window, colour, repo), behind a
#            format version that is bumped whenever the badge layout or the key scheme changes,
#            so lines written by an older script are never served. A mismatch here means the
#            cached line answers a different question, so it must never be shown.
#   stamp  — the transcript's size+mtime. A mismatch here means only that the session moved on,
#            which is exactly when serving the previous line is safe and useful.
#
# Eviction policy: last WRITE wins, not last read. An entry is rewritten on every render where
# the transcript advanced, so "untouched for a week" means the session itself has not advanced
# for a week. A session held open but idle that long loses its entry and pays one in-line
# recompute; refreshing the mtime on every cache HIT would instead put a fork on the hottest
# path in this script — one per keystroke — which costs more than the recompute it avoids.
# Default is the savings figure alone. The context fields were added to answer "is the graph
# actually being used", which is a question for `entire graph stats`, not for a line that has to
# stay readable next to everything else on a status bar -- and one of them (exploration token
# totals) reads as a savings claim the paired benchmark does not support. Opt back in with

# Create $CACHE_DIR, private to this user, refusing a symlinked directory AND any directory this

#
# The gate is an OWNERSHIP TEST, not "chmod exited 0". $TMPDIR is usually unset, so the path is
# predictable (/tmp/entire-graph-statusline-<uid>) and /tmp is world-writable and cleared on boot:
# another user can win the create race and then own the directory this script reads its badge out
# of. Per-uid naming does not help — the victim's uid is in the name — and the symlink checks do not
# help either, because a real directory is not a symlink. Requiring `chmod 700` to succeed is NOT
# sufficient on its own, which was the hole this gate had:
#
#   * chmod(1) ELIDES the chmod(2) call when the mode already matches, so a foreign directory that
#     is already at 0700 exits 0 and gets adopted (asserted on the platform by the test suite).
#     Mode 0700 does not make such a directory unreadable to its victim either: a macOS ACL
#     (`chmod +a "<victim> allow list,search,read,add_file"`) is evaluated independently of the
#     mode bits.
#   * For a uid-0 victim chmod succeeds on EVERY directory, so the check degenerates to a no-op.
#
# `[ -O "$CACHE_DIR" ]` compares st_uid with the effective uid, which is the actual question; it is
# also a shell builtin, so it costs no fork, and it is what refuses an attacker-owned directory when
# the victim is root. The chmod stays behind it, still required, but now only as mode REPAIR on a
# directory we already know is ours (one created by an older version of this script under a loose
# umask). Without this gate a planted record's bytes reach the terminal verbatim (verified:
# \033[2J\033]0;OWNED\007 clears the screen and rewrites the window title), and only the guessable
# CONFIG field has to match, not the stamp.
#
# Memoised on success so a render pays at most one chmod fork, not one per call site. The memo is
