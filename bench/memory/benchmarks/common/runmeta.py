"""Run-metadata capture for benchmark fairness auditing.

Why this exists: a fairness audit of the 2026-08 memory-benchmark matrix could not
determine what configuration each arm actually ran under, because run artifacts
recorded only answerer/judge/provider/top_k/seed. The arm-asymmetric settings
(EG_SESSION_EXPAND, EG_ANSWER_ENUM, --user-profile) lived only in launcher shell
scripts and had to be reconstructed by hand. Every run artifact must now be
self-documenting: config + code identity travel with the numbers.
